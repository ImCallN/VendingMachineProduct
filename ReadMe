The point of this project is to create a working product for the customer, an owner of a vending machine company.
    The customer requested 3 main things:
            -An interface for customers to purchase items from his vending machines.
            -A tool for restockers to quickly and accurately add/remove items.
            -A tool for management to view analytics and adjust changes when needed.
    Within each of these things, certain features were asked for:
            -Customer Asks:
                    - Ability to purchase multiple items.
                    - UI with large buttons from Java Swing.
                    - Ability to purchase items.
                    - Modular enough to add other types of payment methods in at a later date.
                    - Ability to cancel a transaction.
            -Restocker Asks:
                    - Recieve a list of remove items.
                    - Revieve a list of add items.
                    - Scans items and marks off quantity input into the machine to update system.
                    - Mobile app.
            -Management Asks:
                    - Recieve analytics of a machine including:
                        -Location.
                        -Inventory.
                        -Transactions.
                        -List of items to remove.
                        -List of items to add to vending machine.
                        -Locations of items in a vending machine.
                    - Heartbeat of vending machine.

This system is going to be centered around Java objects, as Java is easily portable between multiple platforms.
The way this will break down is:
    A vending machine object:
            -Contains a 2D array of slot objects based on a column length and row length.
            -Keeps track of a location, inventory size, other info as needed.
            -Keeps track of a list of items that need to be removed.
            -Methods to calculate space available, heartbeat, current status.

            As mentioned above, the 2D array inside of a vending machine will represent the items that are contained in
            each "slot". In a 3D terms, this would represent the Z axis.
                A slot will contain:
                    -A depth of how many items deep a slot goes.
                    -An arraylist of items on the slot.
                    -A location of the slot in the vending machine.
                    -Methods to calculate items in slot, to change the amount of items in a slot, tbd.

                    In each slot, there are multiple item objects.
                        An item object will contain:
                            -An ID.
                            -An expiration date.
                            -A price.
                            -A flag to remove an item.
                            -TBD but it could also contain a location in the slot object.
For example, a vending machine with row = 4 and column = 4, should look like:
    [A1][A2][A3][A4]
    [B1][B2][B3][B4]
    [C1][C2][C3][C4]
    [D1][D2][D3][D4]
Each cell here represents a slot. Upon selecting slot B3 that has a depth of 5, we should see:
    [Item_1][Item_2][Item_3][Item_4][Item_5]
Each cell there represents an Item. Upon opening an item object, we should see:
    ID,Price,ExpirationDate,RemoveBoolean


Upon creating this system, we should then be able to start creating individual lists for separate interfaces.
        -The customer interface should not be accessing anything other than what it needs to. That means that they
        won't have the ability to modify prices or increase the count of an item. They should only be able to add
        a cash amount, take items out of the count, and cancel a transaction.
        -The restocker will be able to remove items and add items, but not modify prices or other information pertaining
        specific items
        -The management interface can change information about items and create lists from the information, but cannot add
        or remove items. They can create a new vending machine item though, and provide a list with what to populate or remove,
        but the restocker will be the one that confirms the operation and information of items that were removed or added.

CSV FILES:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Position csv files should be in the format of "int id,int xPos,int yPos,int amount"
        All fields are integers, and go item id, row position, column position, amount of item, respectively

UPDATE 11/29/2022
    CHANGES
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Slot Class
        -Changed the class structure to instead contain an itemID integer instead of an array of item objects. Also
        changed it so that there is not an array anymore, but an integer count of the items in that slot. This means that
        multiple different items cannot be stored in the same slot.
    CSVs
        -Added CSV files to the project as our databases. Currently have a csv for the Item Database and a csv for the
        positions of the items in the vending machine.
    VendingMachine Class
        -Added importCSV method to read in a CSV file, determine whether it is an Item database or Positional Database,
        and read in the information as appropriate. See more in the TODO
    Interface Classes (Main, Restocker, Management, Customer)
        -Created loop method to read in user input and make determinations based on the input
    Customer Class
        -Created a beginTransaction method to read in customer item selection and calculate price/determine if payment
        is satisfied. Possibility of breaking this up into two methods to decouple them, but for now thats a low priority

    TODO [UPDATE AS NEEDED]
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     -Compile a list of known issues
     -Get relevant documents
     -Go over what we will be presenting
     -Testing for bugs. If any are found, add them to the known issues
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    KNOWN ISSUES:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Restocker Issues:
    	Remove List:
    	- Shows all items that are expired in item list, not just items in inventory. (Not priority right now)

    Vending Machine Issues:
    	- populate remove list is not initialized until manually run. This could be fixed by running this on a timer (every 12 hours?)
    	- Items that have a current count of 0 appear in the positions. This is correct based on the import of the DataBase info, but would need to be cleaned up in the future.

    Customer Issues:
        - When customer enters more than the total amount, the change deposited is in double form, but has too many decimal places. Need to round to two decimals

    Management Issues:
        - Anything that takes input will crash if no input is entered
        - removeItemFromDB does not seem to be working, needs some investigation in the FAR FUTURE

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
