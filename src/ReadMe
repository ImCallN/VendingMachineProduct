The point of this project is to create a working product for the customer, an owner of a vending machine company.
    The customer requested 3 main things:
            -An interface for customers to purchase items from his vending machines.
            -A tool for restockers to quickly and accurately add/remove items.
            -A tool for management to view analytics and adjust changes when needed.
    Within each of these things, certain features were asked for:
            -Customer Asks:
                    - Ability to purchase multiple items.
                    - UI with large buttons from Java Swing.
                    - Ability to purchase items.
                    - Modular enough to add other types of payment methods in at a later date.
                    - Ability to cancel a transaction.
            -Restocker Asks:
                    - Recieve a list of remove items.
                    - Revieve a list of add items.
                    - Scans items and marks off quantity input into the machine to update system.
                    - Mobile app.
            -Management Asks:
                    - Recieve analytics of a machine including:
                        -Location.
                        -Inventory.
                        -Transactions.
                        -List of items to remove.
                        -List of items to add to vending machine.
                        -Locations of items in a vending machine.
                    - Heartbeat of vending machine.

This system is going to be centered around Java objects, as Java is easily portable between multiple platforms.
The way this will break down is:
    A vending machine object:
            -Contains a 2D array of slot objects based on a column length and row length.
            -Keeps track of a location, inventory size, other info as needed.
            -Keeps track of a list of items that need to be removed.
            -Methods to calculate space available, heartbeat, current status.

            As mentioned above, the 2D array inside of a vending machine will represent the items that are contained in
            each "slot". In a 3D terms, this would represent the Z axis.
                A slot will contain:
                    -A depth of how many items deep a slot goes.
                    -An arraylist of items on the slot.
                    -A location of the slot in the vending machine.
                    -Methods to calculate items in slot, to change the amount of items in a slot, tbd.

                    In each slot, there are multiple item objects.
                        An item object will contain:
                            -An ID.
                            -An expiration date.
                            -A price.
                            -A flag to remove an item.
                            -TBD but it could also contain a location in the slot object.
For example, a vending machine with row = 4 and column = 4, should look like:
    [A1][A2][A3][A4]
    [B1][B2][B3][B4]
    [C1][C2][C3][C4]
    [D1][D2][D3][D4]
Each cell here represents a slot. Upon selecting slot B3 that has a depth of 5, we should see:
    [Item_1][Item_2][Item_3][Item_4][Item_5]
Each cell there represents an Item. Upon opening an item object, we should see:
    ID,Price,ExpirationDate,RemoveBoolean


Upon creating this system, we should then be able to start creating individual lists for separate interfaces.
        -The customer interface should not be accessing anything other than what it needs to. That means that they
        won't have the ability to modify prices or increase the count of an item. They should only be able to add
        a cash amount, take items out of the count, and cancel a transaction.
        -The restocker will be able to remove items and add items, but not modify prices or other information pertaining
        specific items
        -The management interface can change information about items and create lists from the information, but cannot add
        or remove items. They can create a new vending machine item though, and provide a list with what to populate or remove,
        but the restocker will be the one that confirms the operation and information of items that were removed or added.
